# Automated_Course_Registration
 A script automating the registration of planned courses in the next semester.
 You must plan all your courses for the upcoming semester before launching this program, 
 this simply saves you the hastle of refreshing the registration page frequently waiting 
 for your sections to open spots. You can launch this program before your registration 
 window opens to guarantee you a spot in your desired sections.
